## Noroff Semester Assignment Report

**By Bendik Bjerkeset**

### Introduction

This report details the process of creating a website for a fictitious auction house as part of the Noroff semester assignment. It aims to provide an in-depth overview of the development process, the technologies utilized, challenges encountered, and the methodologies applied throughout the project.

### The Project

The core objective of this assignment was to develop a fully functional website simulating an auction house environment. This encompassed aspects such as user interface design, front-end development, and back-end management.

### Goals and Design Approach

The primary goal was to develop an intuitive and accessible platform, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices. Emphasis was placed on responsive design to cater to a wide range of screen sizes and browsers.

### Technology Stack

The project leveraged modern web technologies for both front-end and back-end development. The front-end was built using Next.js v14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, focusing on interactivity, performance, and adherence to modern development practices. Cypress was employed for end-to-end testing to ensure the applicationâ€™s reliability and functionality. The back-end integration was achieved through a customized API, designed to support the unique functionalities of an auction platform.

### Technical Challenges and Resolutions

A significant challenge was implementing server components with Next.js, balancing code efficiency and state management. Server components enhanced code readability and offloaded processing from the client-side to the server. However, managing state in edge components posed a challenge. To resolve this, I experimented with techniques like client wrappers for server components and utilizing URLs as a medium for state management between client and server. This approach necessitated a comprehensive understanding of TypeScript and Next.js, pushing the limits of my problem-solving skills and deepening my technical knowledge.

### Conclusion

In summary, the Noroff semester assignment to develop a website for a fictitious auction house was a challenging yet rewarding experience. It allowed me to apply advanced web development techniques and problem-solving skills, particularly in utilizing modern technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Overcoming the challenges, especially in state management with server components, has significantly enhanced my understanding and expertise in web development. This project not only fulfilled its academic requirements but also provided me with invaluable insights and practical skills that will be beneficial in my future endeavors in the field of web development.
